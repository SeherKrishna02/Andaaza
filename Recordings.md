## Audio Generated Visuals  

### p5.js

This is an archive of the messages that are engraved in the cups. 
The sound waves are recorded in both the cups and into an audio file. 
A visualization was made in p5.js to accompany the sound recordings.

### Processing  

These images were generated with the audio recordings in Processing using the minm library based on this paper by [Manuel Kretzer](http://responsivedesign.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tutorial-06_processing-soundmapping2.pdf).
